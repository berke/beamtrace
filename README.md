# beamtrace

A library that defines types for representing multi-page line plots,
and allows serializing and deserializing them using MPK in particular.

## What use is this?

I have multiple programs that produce plots, and I use this library
for representing their outputs.  Think old school HPGL plots, but
with multiple page and animation support.
